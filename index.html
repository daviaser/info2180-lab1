 <h2>Davia Howard</h2>
 <p>WELCOME! As stated, my name is Davia Howard. I am currently a second year computer science major and coding enthusiast. <br> In the future, I intend to specialize in web development, UI/UX Design and App Development.
I have some experience in languages such as Python, Java, C, HTML/CSS and Dart. One of my favorite division under computer science is Web Development. 
This is because it combines coding and creativity where you can for example, showcase a brand's personality while reaching potential clients. 
I love the aspect of using code to arrange elements and graphics to create visual appealing and functional end products.
My hobbies include drawing, reading, travelling to different places and more coding!</p>
